1. If Strings are to be sent between entities it needs to be using boost::interprocess::string 
2. Passing ID-s needs to be verified (const& to temporaries)
3. Maybe Id-s should be unique (not copyable nor movalbe) - seems okay
4. But then how to pass them? 


event :
    int i -> okay
    ipc::string -> okay
    event -> okay
    ipc::string& -> nok

// maybe SystemId-s should be events?

Message will have event
